This is my first attempt to create a readme file for my initial exploration of GitHub.
I've created the repository, explore-hello-world
I'm flying by the seat of my pants here.
I have read multiple readme files.  I think I may have edited one or more.  Not sure if I've created one from scratch before
Let's see what happens.

I created the original readme file.  It appears to currently be associated with the master branch.
I think I created a readme-edits file, but I'm not sure.  I opened the readme file and selected the option to edit the file
I notice that the option, "commit directly to the readme-edits branch" is selected below
Everything from line 7 to here has been added prior to selecting the green "commit changes" selection below.

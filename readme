This is my first attempt to create a readme file for my initial exploration of GitHub.
I've created the repository, explore-hello-world
I'm flying by the seat of my pants here.
I have read multiple readme files.  I think I may have edited one or more.  Not sure if I've created one from scratch before
Let's see what happens.

I created the original readme file.  It appears to currently be associated with the master branch.
I think I created a readme-edits file, but I'm not sure.  I opened the readme file and selected the option to edit the file
(What actually happened was I edited the readme file and saved it in the readme-edits branch, which didn't effect the readme file in the master branch.)
I notice that the option, "commit directly to the readme-edits branch" is selected below
Everything from line 7 to here has been added prior to selecting the green "commit changes" selection below.

After editing the readme file and saving the revised file in the readme-edits branch, I reviewed the readme files in both the master and the readme-edits branches.
Then I activated a Pull Request and finally merged the readme file in the readme-edit branch with the readme file in the master branch.
I think this replaced the readme file in the master branch with the readme file in the readme-edit branch.

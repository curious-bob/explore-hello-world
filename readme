This is my first attempt to create a readme file for my initial exploration of GitHub.
I've created the repository, explore-hello-world
I'm flying by the seat of my pants here.
I have read multiple readme files.  I think I may have edited one or more.  Not sure if I've created one from scratch before
Let's see what happens.
